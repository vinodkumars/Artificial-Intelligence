<b> Version 2</b><br/>
The goal of this assignment is to sharpen your math and programming skills
needed for this class.  If you meet the prerequisites, you should find these
problems relatively innocuous.  Some of these problems will occur again
as subproblems of later homeworks, so make sure you know how to do them.

<div class="problemTitle">Problem 1: Optimization and probability</div>

<p>
In this class, we will cast a lot of AI problems as optimization problems, that is, finding the best
solution in a rigorous mathematical sense.
At the same time, we must be adroit at coping with uncertainty in the world,
and for that, we appeal to tools from probability.
</p>

<ol class="problem">

<li class="writeup">
Let $b_1, \dots, b_n$ be real numbers representing positions on a number line.
Let $w_1, \dots, w_n$ be positive numbers representing the importance of these positions.
Define the quadratic function: $f(x) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^n w_i (x - b_i)^2$.
What value $x$ minimizes $f(x)$?
You can think about this problem as trying to find the point $x$ that's not too far
away from the points $b_i$'s.
Over time, hopefully you'll appreciate how nice quadratic functions are to minimize.
</li>

<li class="writeup">
In this class, there will be a lot of sums and maxes.
Let's see what happens if we switch the order.
Let $f(x) = \max_{a \in \{1,-1\}} \sum_{j=1}^d a x_j$
and $g(x) = \sum_{j=1}^d \max_{a \in \{1,-1\}} a x_j$,
where $x = (x_1, \dots, x_d) \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is a real vector.
What is the relationship (comparison) between $f(x)$ and $g(x)$?
</li>

<li class="writeup">
Suppose you start a counter at zero.
You repeat the following $n$ times:
Roll a fair six-sided dice. If the number of dots is at least $4$,
then add it to the counter; otherwise, do nothing.
What is the expected value of the final counter?
Do the dice rolls have to be independent for the expected value to be calculated? Explain.
</li>

<li class="writeup">
Suppose the probability of a coin turning up heads is $0 &lt; p &lt; 1$,
and that we flip it 5 times and get $\{ \text{H}, \text{T}, \text{T}, \text{H}, \text{H} \}$.
We know the probability (likelihood) of obtaining this
sequence is $L(p) = p (1-p) (1-p) p p = p^3 (1-p)^2$.
Now let's go backwards and ask the question: what is the value of $p$ that maximizes $L(p)$?
Hint: consider taking the derivative of $\log L(p)$.
</li>

<li class="writeup">
Let's practice taking derivatives of vector-valued functions.
For $\mathbf w \in \mathbb R^d$ and constants $a_i, b_j \in \mathbb R^d$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb R$, define
$$f(\mathbf w) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n (a_i^\top \mathbf w - b_j^\top \mathbf w)^2 + \lambda \|\mathbf w\|_2^2.$$
Compute the gradient $\nabla f(\mathbf w)$.
</li>

</ol>

<div class="problemTitle">Problem 2: Complexity</div>

<p>
When designing algorithms, it's useful to be able to do quick back of the
envelope calculations to see how much time or space an algorithm needs.
Hopefully, you'll start to get more intuition for this by being exposed
to more types of problems.
</p>

<ol class="problem">

<li class="writeup">
Suppose we have a sentence consisting of $n$ words and want to label each word with
one of following four tags: noun, verb, adjective, or other.
How many possible tag sequences are there?
</li>

<li class="writeup">
Suppose we have an image of a human face consisting of $n \times n$ pixels.
In our simplified setting, a face consists of two eyes and one mouth,
each represented as an arbitrary axis-aligned rectangle.  As we'd like
to handle Picasso portraits too, there are no constraints on the location or
size of the rectangles.
How many possible faces (choice of its component rectangles) are there?
In general, we only care about asymptotic complexity,
so give your answer in the form of $O(n^c)$ or $O(c^n)$ for some integer $c$.
</li>

<li class="writeup">
Suppose we have $n$ cities on the number line: $1, 2, \dots, n$.
Define a function $c(i, j)$ which returns the cost of going from city $i$
to city $j$, and assume it takes constant time to compute.
We want to travel from $1$ to $n$ via a set of intermediate cities, but only
moving forwards.
We can compute the minimum cost of doing this by defining
the following relation: $f(j) = \min_{1 &le; i &lt; j} [c(i, j) + f(i)]$.
How much time (just give the big-O) does it take to compute $f(n)$ in the most 
efficient way?
</li>

<li class="writeup">
Consider the vector-valued function $f(\mathbf w)$ from Problem 1e.
Devise a strategy that first does preprocessing in $O(n d^2)$ time,
and then takes $O(d^2)$ time instead to compute $f(\mathbf w)$ for each given
vector $\mathbf w$.
</li>

<div class="problemTitle">Problem 3: Programming</div> 

<ol class="problem">

<p>
<li class="code"> 
In this problem, you will implement a bunch of short functions.  The main
purpose of this exercise is to familiarize yourself with Python,
but as a bonus, the functions that you will implement will come in handy in
subsequent homeworks.
</li>
</p>

<p>
If you're new to Python, the following provide pointers to various
tutorials and examples for the language:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers">Python for Programmers</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/SimplePrograms">Example programs of increasing complexity</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
You should modify the code in <a href="submission.py"><code>submission.py</code></a>,
between <pre># BEGIN_YOUR_CODE</pre> and <pre># END_YOUR_CODE</pre> but
you can add other helper functions if you choose (for this homework, you
shouldn't need to do this).
</p>

<p>
To test your code, we have provided some sample test cases.  To run them, type:
<pre>python grader.py</pre>
Note that these test cases are very basic and do not stress your code with
large inputs or tricky corner cases.  You should add some of your own test
cases as well, because you will be graded on more difficult test cases.
